# CollegeSimulator

## Overview
The College Application Simulator is a Java-based program designed to simulate the college application process. It allows users to interact with a simulated college application system, answering questions related to academics, extracurriculars, and preferences to generate admission chances for various colleges. The program provides insights into admission possibilities, including interview strengths and admission chances for a list of predefined colleges.

**Student Profile:**
Collects and displays user information, including name, GPA, essay strength, course rigor, extracurriculars, SAT, and ACT scores.

**Demographic Features:**
(a) Select ethnicity
(b) Choose income level
(c) Indicate if a student is the first generation to attend college

**Application Simulation:**
Allows users to simulate the application process by answering questions and receiving admission chances for a list of colleges.

**Random College Selection:**
Option to randomly select colleges for application.

**Recommended Colleges:**
Recommends colleges based on simulated user statistics (GPA, SAT, ACT, course rigor, essay strength, extracurriculars, demographics).

**Interview Simulation:**
Simulates interview strengths for each school.

**Admission Chances:**
Calculates and displays admission chances for each college based on simulated application data.

**Decision Making:**

**Final College Decision:**
Allows the user to choose a college from the accepted list.

**Score Calculation:**
Calculates a score and average score based on the colleges accepted.
